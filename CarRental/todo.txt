•	Make use of the www.hertz.no webpage as the “template” for your webpage,
but stop at their social media bar (exclude everything below).

•	On the “car guide” in the top menu, create another page with a list of categories
 of cars (A, B, C, D) with images of typical cars in the category and daily/weekly/weekend rental price for each category.
  The user should be able to choose a car from here and then get to a form (new page for making the order.

•	On the other main menus (at top) and the <Sales>, <Deals>, <30%> etc. – lead these to the same
info page (“Service not implemented yet”).

•	From the main page – the user should also be able to rent a car.

•	Information about the rental: location (return same place to simplify), date/time for pick-up and delivery,
 car category (option to get to the more information), and the Order option.

•	The order option brings the user to a new page where info is displayed and can be changed, and then for
the customer to confirm or regret. You do have some freedom here (can use dummy values) 
